# SkeldServerSwitcher
This is a prototype of a serverswitcher for windows 7 and above. Fully written in java.

Steps on how to use this.
**JAVA 1.8 (8) IS REQUIRED**

1. Download the jar file, click [here](https://github.com/apollyon600/SkeldServerSwitcher/releases/download/1.0/ServerSwitcher.jar)
*I highly recommend to put it in your downloads folder for easier access*
2. Open your command prompt (type `cmd` in the search bar)
3. Run the command `java -jar C:/Users/**PCNAME**/Downloads/ServerSwitcher.jar`
4. Let it do its magic!
5. Report any bugs in the [skeld.net](https://discord.gg/yZ698WRsgs) server! 

## Bonus
If you do not want to use the command prompt, you can create a .bat file to run it for you!

1. Head to your file explorer, create a .txt file and open it
2. Just type the following: `java -jar C:/Users/**PCNAME**/Downloads/ServerSwitcher.jar`
3. Save the file and close it
4. Rename the extension of .txt to .bat
5. You can now double click it to run the switcher!
